Filter-banks on arbitrary graphs
===============
* [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/graph_filterbank_folding) for our [2023 TSP paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077793)

3D point clouds
===============
* [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/RA-GFT) for our   [ICIP 2020 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01866) on compression of 3d point cloud attributes with the region adaptive graph Fourier transform (RAGFT).

* [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/3D_point_cloud_sampling) for our [2024 3D point cloud sampling paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01027)

* [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/FRSVR-PCQA) for our [2023 ICIP](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIPC59416.2023.10328379) and our [2025 Signal Processing](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2024.117239) papers on full reference 3D point cloud quality assessment

* [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/NRSVR-PCQA) for our [2023 ICIP](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIPC59416.2023.10328379) paper on Non-reference 3D point cloud quality assessment

Graph learning
==============
* Combinatorial Graph Laplacian Estimator (CGLE) [Matlab/C-mex code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/graph_learning_CombLap). This is an  implementation of  the algorithm from our [2019 Asilomar paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08451) to estimate combinatorial graph Laplacian constrained precision matrices. 

* Graph learning [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/Graph_Learning) for our [IEEE TSIPN 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02553) and [IEEE JSTSP 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02553) papers. If interested in the combinatorial graph Laplacian, the    algorithm  from Asilomar 2019 is faster and more accurate.

* [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/graph_learning_properties) to estimate generalized graph Laplacians (GGL), also known as M-matrices, with topoogy properties (trees, bipartite, sparse) from our [IEEE TSP 2018 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10934).
