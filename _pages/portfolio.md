3D point clouds
===============
* [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/RA-GFT) for our   [ICIP 2020 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01866) on compression of 3d point cloud attributes with the region adaptive graph Fourier transform (RAGFT).

Graph learning
==============
* Combinatorial Graph Laplacian Estimator (CGLE) [Matlab/C-mex code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/graph_learning_CombLap). This is an  implementation of  the algorithm from our [2019 Asilomar paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08451) to estimate combinatorial graph Laplacian constrained precision matrices. 

* Graph learning [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/Graph_Learning) for our [IEEE TSIPN 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02553) and [IEEE JSTSP 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02553) papers. If interested in the combinatorial graph Laplacian, the    algorithm  from Asilomar 2019 is faster and more accurate.

* [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/graph_learning_properties) to estimate generalized graph Laplacians (GGL), also known as M-matrices, with topoogy properties (trees, bipartite, sparse) from our [IEEE TSP 2018 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10934).
