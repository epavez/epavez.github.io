3D point clouds
===============
* Region adaptive graph fourier transform for compression of 3d point cloud attributes [Matlab code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/RA-GFT), this implements the transform proposed in  [ICIP 2021 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01866)

Graph learning
==============
* Combinatorial Graph Laplacian Estimator (CGLE) [Matlab/C-mex code](https://github.com/STAC-USC/graph_learning_CombLap). This code implements the algorithm from our [2019 Asilomar paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08451).
