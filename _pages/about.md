I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California working with [Prof. Antonio Ortega](http://biron.usc.edu/wiki/index.php/Antonio_Ortega). 
I am particularly interested in developing scalable graph signal processing algorithms by leveraging tools from graph theory, optimization and statistics.
My research  covers various aspects of  signal processing such as:

* Graph learning
* Multiresolutions on graphs
* 3D point clouds
* Multimedia compression
* Covariance estimation
