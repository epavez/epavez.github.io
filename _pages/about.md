I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California with Antonio Ortega. 

My research  is on various aspects of  signal processing such as:

* Graph learning
* Multiresolutions on graphs
* 3D point clouds
* Multimedia compression
* Covariance estimation
 
 I am particularly interested in developing scalable graph signal processing algorithms by leveraging tools from graph theory, optimization and statistics.
